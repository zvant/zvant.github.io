<p>This work is an undergraduate  student physical experiment project supported by School of Physical Sciences of USTC in fall 2012. It is a team work by me and four co-workers, they are: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/caoyuan/www/index.html">Yuan Cao</a>, Qiao Kong, Xingzhou Tu and Lu Qiu. Most of the experiment is carried out in HFNL and the Center of Physical Experiment of USTC.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is  to make graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFET), for its potentially  high speed and density. The idea is inspired by the work of Yang, et al. in 2012:

<p>GFET is a type of FET device using the Schottky  barrier between graphene and silicon to a conduct, which is modulated by the  voltage on the top gate. Graphene has very high electron mobility, GFET is  likely to achieve high operating speed. The GFET could be used in a float-gate  FET to make a memory device.</p>
<p>Graphene is prepared by Chemical Vapor  Deposition (CVD) of methane on copper, and then transferred to monocrystalline substrate  with silicon dioxide layer on the surface using the PMMA method. The silicon (100)  are N-type doped with doping density of about 10<sup>16</sup>, with 500nm SiO<sub>2</sub>  layer.</p>

<p>Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize  the graphene both on copper and silicon, which indicates that the graphene is single  layer.</p>

<p>Two drops of silver glue are added onto the  graphene, another added to the silicon substrate as electrode.</p>

<p>The monocrystalline is cut  into 1 CM x 1 CM pieces, and a small hole etched by hydrofluoric acid,  so the SiO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved and silicon exposed. Then graphene is transfered onto the boundary. Two drops of silver glue are added both on the graphene and silicon to act as the electrodes.

<p>Due to the Schottky barrier on the graphene-silicon interface, light with sufficient energy would excite electrons and the remaining holes are swept in different directions by the built-in electric field of the depletion region, which creates an electric current (known as the Photovoltage Effect). This current could be used as the indicator of light. The I-V curve of this device in darkness and semiconductor laser are shown below.</p>
